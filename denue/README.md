Exploring half a million businesses in Mexico City

## Setup

The following script downloads data from INEGI, unzips, filter out, and transform to vector tilesets. All files are placed in a `./data/` directory.

```bash
./data.sh
```

A few utilities are needed on your system to run this: [GDAL](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS), [Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md) and [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe).
